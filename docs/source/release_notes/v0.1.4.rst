Version 0.1.4
=================

Release Date: December 08, 2024

🌟 Overview
------------
Improves FedAvg implementation with proper weighting based on client dataset sizes, enhances model versioning, and fixes type-related issues.

📝 Detailed Notes
------------------
Improved FedAvg implementation to properly weight client contributions based on their dataset sizes and save the client weights. Additionally, several type-related issues have been fixed.

🎁 Features
------------
- Implemented proper dataset size-based weighting in FedAvg aggregator
- Added client waits to training metrics
- Enhanced model versioning with support for weighted metrics

🐛 Bug Fixes
-------------
- Fixed averaging in FedAvg to properly weight based on client dataset sizes
- Fixed MNIST data loader type hints
- Fixed model versioning integration with the server and coordinator

📚 Documentation
-----------------
- Updated the release process.
- Updated the ``ModelManager`` section in Concepts Guide.

♻️ Code Refactoring
-------------------
- Updated ``ModelManager`` integration with server and coordinator components.
- Improved aggregator interface with proper weight computation abstraction.
- Simplified checkpointing by removing redundant storage.

🧪 Tests
--------
- Added tests for weighted FedAvg.
- Updated test cases to verify proper client weight calculations.
- Added test coverage for missing sample counts in metrics.

📦 Build System
----------------
- Added an automated release script.

🔧 Maintenance
---------------
